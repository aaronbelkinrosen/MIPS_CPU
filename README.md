# MIPS_CPU
This project is an implementation of a basic MIPS CPU with an ISA composed of 5 R-type, 3 I-type, and 1 J-type instructions. The design follows the description in Chapter 4 of Computer Organization and Design by David Patterson and John Hennessy. I would like to add more capabilities, such as more arithmetic operations and a floating point unit, in the future.
